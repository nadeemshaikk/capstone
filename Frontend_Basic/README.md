📁 Frontend_Basic - Capstone Project UI (Version 1)
This folder contains the first version of the frontend for the Capstone project. It includes basic static pages for:

🏠 Home Page

🛒 Buy Page

💼 Selling Page

🔐 Login/Register Page

🛠️ Current Status
This is the initial static version of the frontend.

Pages are built with basic structure and layout.

No dynamic data or backend connectivity is implemented yet.

🔄 Next Steps
Convert static content to dynamic rendering (using React states/props or external data sources).

Modify hardcoded content with real data.

Set up proper form validations and UI interactions.

Create necessary API endpoints in the backend.

Connect frontend to backend services (via REST APIs).





# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
